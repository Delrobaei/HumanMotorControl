This repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and related materials developed for the Human Motor Control course 
offered by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at K. N. Toosi University of Technology. The code is designed exclusively for 
educational purposes—to illustrate theoretical concepts, support classroom instruction, and enhance student understanding through 
practical examples and simulations.

These materials are intended solely for academic use and should not be applied in any medical, clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, 
or patient-related context. The codes have not been validated for safety, accuracy, or reliability in real-world health or biomedical 
applications, and such use is expressly prohibited.

Public use of the codes are permitted for non-commercial, educational purposes, provided that proper citation and clear attribution 
are given to the Human Motor Control course and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at K. N. Toosi University of Technology. 
Any adaptation or redistribution must retain this acknowledgment.

The repository is actively maintained and regularly updated to reflect current course content and pedagogical needs. All materials are 
provided “as is,” and K. N. Toosi University of Technology, the course instructor, and contributors disclaim any liability for misuse, 
especially in safety-critical or medical settings.
